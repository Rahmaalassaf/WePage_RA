              A digital avatar is a graphical representation of a user or a
              user's character performing a certain task. It can be a
              two-dimensional icon, as seen on social networking platforms and
              forums, or a threedimensional figure, as seen in games or virtual
              worlds.Despite its reputation as a form of entertainment, numerous
              organizations throughout the world have begun to recognize their
              value in industries such as healthcare, advertising, and
              soft-skills development (XpertVR, 2021).The term "avatar" comes
              from Hinduism, and it refers to a deity's "descent" into a
              terrestrial form.

            Avatar bodies are created using modern technology to match human
            bodies, which are then mindlinked to these "Avatars" for remote
            control operation. The artificially intelligent avatar, which is a
            computer representation of a person that looks like a video or a
            photo but has intelligence, simulates how our brain conducts speech
            to provide human-like contact(Poondru Prithvinath Reddy, 2020).

                  The origins of Avatar can be traced back to the early 1970s,
                  when two NASA employees named Steve Colley and Howard Palmer
                  created MazeWar, a multiplayer game.

                  They interacted with other early computer users via the
                  ARPANET, a forerunner to the Internet created by the Pentagon
                  and a number of colleges.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Players were first represented by words or numbers as they
                  moved through the maze. But, according to Bruce Damer, a
                  graphical eyeball that traveled through the maze with its
                  cyclops gaze focused in the direction it moved - or at the
                  other players it was ready to shoot - was the first avatar
                  (Inquirer Published Mar 18, 2007).

                  Computers began to make their way into everyday houses. They
                  may connect to a variety of computer networks and communicate
                  exclusively with computers on the same network. With a
                  Commodore 64 computer, Lucas Films employees Chip Morningstar
                  and Randy Farmer created the virtual environment Habitat.

                  Users created cartoon-like avatars by picking heads and bodies
                  from a menu. They may then stroll around a digital space and
                  converse with each other, with their remarks showing in chat
                  boxes over their heads(Inquirer Published Mar 18, 2007).

                  The avatar phenomenon truly took off when the numerous
                  computer networks came together to become the Internet.Many
                  multiplayer games and virtual social spaces were developed,
                  but only a handful of them survived due to a lack of revenue.

                  Phillip Rosedale, the CEO and founder of Linden Labs, had a
                  different perspective. "He had the impression that it was far
                  too soon. The majority of individuals were still using dial-up
                  connections "For many virtual-world applications, these are
                  too slow(Inquirer Published Mar 18, 2007).
